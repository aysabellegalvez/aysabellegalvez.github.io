			The making of media starts from the storage of information. The Atlantic article "As We May Think" states that, "A record if it is to be useful in science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted," (Bush). This quote closely relates to web development, as the World Wide Web started by Web 1.0 as a phenomena of the storing of information on computers. Today, with hundreds of different methods of storing information, it is up to the storer to decide how to display that information - this is a more creative approach to information.

			The power of the Internet is that it allows for decentralization. Tim Berners-Lee in his article "Long Live the Web" points out that one doesn't need money or permission to create their own online presence - "When the Web began, I did not have to obtain permission or pay royalties to use the Internet's own open standards," (Berners-Lee). 
			<p>
			However, on the other hand, there are "closed worlds," which are contrary to the open source of the Internet, requiring some sort of membership to be accessed. A great example of a closed world that Berners-Lee gives is Apple's iTunes. Music streaming apps (like today's well-known Spotify or Apple Music) require payment for use, not allowing everyone to access their content, nor letting their users send their content to outsiders. Berners-Lee states that those who make "closed worlds" are very confident in their ability to have other people want their applications enough to pay for them, and this is very true. Music can easily be streamed on public websites like Youtube, but the ability to stream music while not actively on the app and the overall UX design of these platforms are what intrigues people to purchase them.

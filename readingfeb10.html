		<u> Episode 1: </u>
		<p> Paintings or pictures can be very simple on their own accord - when you are looking at them simply from straight ahead. But, there are so many different - unnoticeable - ways in which the meaning of a picture can change. Focusing on a single detail or part of the image (whether it's zooming in or cropping via a digital screen or using the natural eye to focus on the detail) can alter the meaning of an image. The video shows examples of paintings in which a different story could be told when part of the picture is out of sight. (for an example, a crowd onlooking an event could show the popularity of the event; while zooming in on the event could be seen as a simple memorial depiction). The episode continues to show more different ways in which the meaning of a picture can be changed; for example, the meaning of the picture can be influenced by the current emotions of the viewer or what the viewer has experienced prior to the sight of that photo. <p>

		<u> Episode 2: </u>
		<p> This episode is about the sexualization of women in European art. John Berger explains the subtle yet impactful ways that women are portrayed in art. Nudity, glances, and facial expressions all make up the sexualization. Berger explains the purposeful glances of the women in the painting to the (most likely male) viewer of the painting can turn a painting from simple nudity to sexualization. The main idea I got from this episode is that there are small details in the depiction of women that much turn nudity into sexualization - without the viewer realizing it. <p>
		<p>
		<u> Episode 3: </u>
		<p> I found it fascinating that art can portray or represent inequalities without actually depicting it. European portraits, as Berger explained, were only of the upper class, which was nowhere near the majority of the population. The lives of the poor went "unrecorded." Art is a representation of anything in life, and the lack of representation in art of non-wealthy people erases them from history. 
		<p> 
		<u> Episode 4: </u>
		<p> Publicity is based on the desire for a certain way of life that is portrayed that the audience hasn't attained. The inability for many to financially reach these lifestyles is what publicity grows on. Photography and paintings are a way of delivering publicity. They are designed to make the "actors" in these images seem happy with the objects that they are surrounded by, urging the audience to buy through playing with the audience's emotions of jealousy.
